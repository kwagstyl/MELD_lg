Comparison of MELD lesion distributions with gene expression maps

/images show parcellated (HCP) and raw maps of lesion topographies for:
  - all patients (heterogeneous, primarily FCD but some not yet histologically confirmed)
  - FCD type 2s : a combined map of FCD 2As and 2Bs. These are by the most common type of FCD (We have 205 FCD2s, 20 FCD1s and 8 FCD3s). Histologically type 2Bs are distinguished from type 2As by the presence of balloon cells and radiologically by the presence of transmantle signs on FLAIR - hyperintensities which extend from the ventricles to the focal lesion. However, there is currently no convincing evidence that these subtypes are genetically or aetiologically distinct.
  - FCD type 2A
  - FCD type 2B
  - FCD type 2B - 2A : The 2A and 2B lesion location maps are different, this characterises those different topographies.
  
/data are the parcellated values, averaged across each ROI in the HCP atlas. These are for:
  - all patients 
  - FCD type 2s
  - FCD 2B - 2A difference map.
These are the three maps for the Allen analysis.
  
All maps have been normalised by the number of subjects (100x_vert/n_subjects).

/scripts contains a demo script for loading in the parcellations.
